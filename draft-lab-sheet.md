# Lab 10

This week, we will bring everything together and hook the SPA project viewer we created last week to a backend API provided by Django. By the end of the lab you should understand:

- How we can make asynchronous requests to a backend API from a frontend application
- How we can use ReactQuery to manage the state of the data we fetch from the backend
- How we can dynamically update the UI based on the data we fetch from the backend

Overall, this will bring together all the concepts we have learned so far in the course and give you a good understanding of how to build a full-stack application using Django and React. Further, it brings our lab sessions to a close.
